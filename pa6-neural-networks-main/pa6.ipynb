    "Finally, $b$ is a scalar added to every element of the vector $XW$, and $\\sigma()$ is the\n",
    "sigmoid function.\n",

It is a big chunk of code and can be intimidating, since it contains all of its necessary features and methods in one piece -- an unfortunate fact of python class definitions. But do not fear! We've broken it down into steps, and have written intermediate unit tests and sanity checks to guide you along the way.\n",
    "\n",
    "Follow the following steps and you can implement a neural network of your own! \n",

    "- **[STEP 5](#step5): Implement the `backward_pass()` method**. You will implement backward propogation to compute gradients for weights in the neural network.\n",
    "- **[STEP 6](#step6): Debug/run a sanity check for the the `backward_pass()` method**. This code cell provides some sample code to debug `forward_pass()`, if you're stuck.\n",

    "**Important coding tip 1:** When writing code for neural networks, it is useful to frequently check the shape of any intermediate vectors or tensors as you are writing them, instead of implementing the whole forward/backward method without testing in one setting and try to debug later. To do this, use a toy input to call the `forward_pass()` or `backward_pass()` function, even though it might not be completely implemented, and print out as much information as you can! We've provided some code in STEP 4 and STEP 6 for you to do this.\n",

Then $a_l$ will be of shape (N, D2). Essentially, the matrix multiplication between $a_{l-1}$ and $W$ maps each example's features of size D1 (as a row vector in $a_{l-1}$) into a new set of features of size D2 (as a row vector in $a_{l}$). The transformation is non-linear because $f()$ is a non-linear function, and all examples are transformed in parallel without interfering with each other. (Think about why this is the case!)\n",
